#  variables and arguments

## assignment
```
name=value                # format, no spaces in between = sign
greetings="Hello World"   # assigns a string with a space
number=42                 # assign a number
```

## accessing values

```
W1="hello"
W2="WOLRD"
echo "$GREETING" # Outputs: Hello World
echo $NUMBER     # Outputs: 42
```

## variable naming
- names can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores but cannot start with a number
- they are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are different).

## Types of Variables
Bash categorizes variables by their scope and purpose.
- User-defined Created by the user, local to the current shell or script.
```
my_var="value"
```
- Environment
    Global settings accessible by child processes.
```
export PATH
```
- Local Limited to the function in which they are defined.
```
local my_var="value"
```
- Special, Reserved, built-in variables that store dynamic data about the shell or script execution.
```
$0, $?
```

## Special Variables
Bash includes several automatic variables for script and process information, such as:
- $0 : The script's filename.
- $1, $2, ...: Command-line arguments.
- $#: The number of arguments.
- $?: The exit status of the last command.
- $$: The current script's Process ID.
- $USER, $HOSTNAME, $SECONDS: Environment variables with system information.

Advanced Usage
- Command Substitution: Store command output in a variable using `$(command)` or \`command\`.
```
file_count=$(ls -l | wc -l)
echo "There are $file_count files."

```

## Read-only Variables
Use readonly or declare -r to prevent value changes after assignment.

## Unsetting Variables
Use unset to remove a variable.
